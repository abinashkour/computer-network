Project: Develop a network simulator implementing entire protocol stack.

1. Implement Physical layer functionalities.
   
• Minimum deliverables: Your simulator should be at least capable of – Creating end devices, hubs – Creating connections between them to form a topology – Sending and receiving data

2.Implement Data Link layer functionalities.

• Minimum deliverables: Your simulator should be at least capable of – Creating layer 2 devices: bridge and switch – Performing address learning in case of switch – Implement at least one error control protocol 1 – Implement at least one access control protocol – Implementing at least one sliding window-based flow control protocol
